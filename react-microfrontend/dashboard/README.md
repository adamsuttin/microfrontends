# Dashboard app

This is a very small, standalone Dashboard application.

## Getting started

### Step 1. Install dependencies

Open your terminal and change to this directory. If you are using `yarn` as a package manager, run:
``` sh
yarn install
```

Otherwise, if `npm` is your preferred choice _(or usable option)_, run:

``` sh
npm install
```

### Step 2: Build the application:

Let's build Dashboard app by running:

``` sh
yarn build
```

or:

``` sh
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Run the application:

Once the application is built successfully, we can run it by typing:

``` sh
yarn start
```

or

``` sh
npm start
```

Running this command should serve the Dashboard application locally on port `4001`.
